## Project Motivation

The purpose of this project consist in understand the market of Airbnb in Seattle. To achive this I decided to used a dataset of Airbnb to answer the following questions:

1. How are the prices of Airbnb rentals in Seattle?

2. Which variables correlate with the price of the rent?

3. Can we predict the rent of your home?

## File Descriptions

There is a [notebook](https://github.com/gutorres93/udacity_p1/blob/main/Udacity_P1.ipynb) available in this repository with all the necessary steps to reach the results of this project.

## Results
